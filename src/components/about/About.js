            We don't believe in keeping it bound to just software development
            and hence the hackathons contain problem statements from every
            domain, be it{" "}
            <strong className="font-[Roboto]">SOFTWARE DEV</strong>,{" "}
            <strong className="font-[Roboto]">AI ML , BLOCKCHAIN</strong> or be
            it{" "}

            House of Geeks, the Technical Society of IIITR, has always supported
            inclusion and diversity and moving forward on this track we would be
            organizing various events during the hackathon to keep the
            participants engaged in a productive way. Our aim is to create such
            an environment where hackers would get an immense knowledge and a
            lifelong experience.
